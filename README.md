# This is a flashcard app
*********************
+ This is being written more for the practice than to recreate the wheel
+ I wanted a project to practice integrating JavaScript and HTML from scratch
+ I also wanted a way to help my kids learn to read
+ I hate paper flash cards

# The failed attempt folder

+ This represents my code progress
+ Some things are in here I included in the prod  file
+ Some stuff I never used
+ Some stuff here just did not work
+ I thought it would be nice to see the progression.  I may remove these later
